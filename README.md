### ABOUT

Scrolld.js is a unique open source plugin for jQuery.
Scrolld.js provides a method for highly precise scrolling for pixel-perfect layouts and navigation using real-time updated data values.
With Scrolld.js your scrolling to items will always be exact and will always provide the best user experience.
Scrolld.js is specifically designed to support responsive designs and turns navigating long pages into a simple task.
Scrolld.js is intended for easy use and is fully deployable within minutes.

* Scrolld.js is simple and works with just an element id tag. *

### HOW TO USE

**1** - Download the source & upload it to your server.

**2** - Place the script include file on your page: 

Ex:

 ```html
 <script type="text/javascript" src="../js/scrolld.js"></script>
 ```

**3** - Place this trigger script at bottom of body:

Ex:
```html
<script type="text/javascript">
$("[id*='Btn']").stop(true).on('click',function(e){e.preventDefault();$(this).scrolld();})
</script>
```

**4** - Use specific id tags to control scrolling, one for the anchor & one for the target.
Anchor id must be in the format of *Btn and target id must be *.

Ex:
```html
<a id='useBtn' class='*' href='*'>
<div id='use' class='*'>
```

**5** - Keep the defaults or easily tweak the settings for a custom fit.

### TWEAKS

Scrolld.js was built with quick and simple customization in mind. You can easily customize the entire experience with these few parameters. 

```javascript
// *Head to the defaults section of the Scrolld.js / Scrolld.min.js file *

Web Settings: 

var scrolldDistance = scrolldPre;
var scrolldDistanceMin = scrolldPre;
var scrolldSpeed = speed11;
var scrolldEasing = 'scrolldEasing1';
var scrolldFixed = true;

Mobile Settings:

var scrolldMobile = true;
var scrolldMobileWidth = 979;
var scrolldMobileDistance = scrolldPre;
var scrolldMobileDistanceMin = scrolldPre;
var scrolldMobileSpeed = speed11;
var scrolldMobileEasing = 'scrolldEasing1';
var scrolldMobileFixed = true;

// * Located the top of the Scrolld.js / Scrolld.min.js file *

Additional Settings:

var scrolldCustom = 0;
var scrolldNavBar = 'fixedNavBar';
var scrolldMobileNavBar = 'fixedNavBar';
```
Targeting A Single Div Easing - Web, Or Mobile, Or Both:

Simply give the anchor a class name of the desired easing method, include Mobile at the end of the class to target only mobile, include both to target both.

Ex:
```html
<a id='useBtn' class='easeOutBounce easeOutBounceMobile' href='*'>
```
Trigger a function after scroll completes, on animation end - Anything you want, toggle classes, alerts, etc:

Script is located at the bottom of the plugin file, simply insert your desired functions there.

Ex:
```javascript
$(":animated").promise().done(function(){
//Write function here    
});
```
